  main/about_us_text: "<p><!--StartFragment--></p>\r\n<p>CareerTrackers is a national
    non-profit organisation that creates internship opportunities for Indigenous university
    students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Leveraging the 45-year legacy of the INROADS African-American
    internship program in the&nbsp;United States, CareerTrackers has adapted this
    model to address Indigenous disadvantage throughout Australia.</p>\r\n<p>CareerTrackers
    supports pre-professional Indigenous university students and links them with private
    sector employers to participate in paid multi-year internships.&nbsp;Students
    perform their internship with a sponsoring company with the aim of converting
    from intern into full-time employee upon completion of their university degree.</p>\r\n<p>In
    addition to making long-lasting placements CareerTrackers provides a wide spectrum
    of support to help prepare students for leadership in the workplace and the community.</p>"

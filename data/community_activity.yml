    action: The Settlement – Redfern, NSW 
    description: CareerTrackers Alumni have developed a partnership with The Settlement Neighbourhood Centre that supports youth and families within the communities of Redfern and Waterloo.
    activity: Several CareerTrackers Alumni have created an effective partnership with the Settlement neighbourhood centre based in Redfern developing and supporting key projects for Indigenous youth in the Redfern and Waterloo areas. The current success of the program has been greatly helped by the wonderful support of Coca-Cola Amatil in assisting with the reduced costs of catering for events through donating products. Qantas has also helped the program where more than 500 gifts were donated to families in the Redfern and Waterloo area due to the Settlement being fortunate enough to be the recipient of the Qantas Christmas Drive. <br><br>One of the initiatives of the community program has seen the development of the Settlement’s first Leadership Program with the aim to grow youth’s leadership abilities and linking the importance of culture, self-esteem and education towards achieving success. The education component of the program consisted of two excursions to Qantas and The University of Technology Sydney courtesy of CareerTrackers Alumni hosting and organising the events and sharing their stories. The uniqueness of the program not only focuses on Indigenous youth to attend events, it also encourages all young people to be involved as part of cultural inclusion. This enables youth in the area from all backgrounds to experience commonalities and cultural differences within the diverse cultural realm of their community. A cultural immersion leadership trip to Alice Springs was evident of this and fitting to celebrate the dedication and hard work the youth have showcased throughout the program courtesy of the support from CareerTrackers 10 year partners in Lendlease and Qantas. The program has already shown great impact on the community through these initiatives and is looking to create ongoing resources in order for the project to be sustainable to provide further opportunities for more youth.

    action: Gawamga Jina Indigenous Careers Academy - Brisbane, Qld
    description: Utilising the networks and experiences of successful Alumni and other Indigenous professionals to empower high school students towards a better future.
    activity: Gawamga Jina means the ‘right track’ in Jandai language from the Quandamooka people of South-East Queensland. This name was provided by Noonuccal man, Matt Chilly and confirmed by community Elders who we have been working with to establish the academy at the pilot school – Capalaba State College. The framework of the program has CareerTrackers Alumni as the drivers where each month the Alumni and their employer are assigned to run a careers workshop to inform Indigenous students about different career pathways. <br><br> The partnerships with Gawamga Jina Indigenous Careers Academy ensures that companies are not only partnering with various talented CareerTrackers Alumni in different industries, but also the ever-expanding network of corporates and universities who support the CareerTrackers Internship Program, local Indigenous community organisations, participating high schools and all those individuals who contribute to making the vision of the program a reality. Please reach out to CareerTrackers to register your interest or discuss ideas.

    action: Power of Engineering (POE) – Sydney, NSW
    description: The vision for the Power of Engineering program is to run integrated workshops with CareerTrackers Alumni for Indigenous students to inspire the next generation of Indigenous engineering leaders.
    activity: Through CareerTrackers’ extensive Indigenous networks, the POE program utilises these contacts to reach more remote communities with indepth and supported consideration to cultural awareness. <br><br>CareerTrackers Alumni in particular can be utilised to reach communities where they are from, meaning the POE can provide engineering workshops to individuals who may have otherwise been missed in areas with a potentially higher Indigenous population. Alumni in different industries and companies pitch their program and provide early support to youth’s needs to enable them to successfully graduate from university, making a degree in engineering more accessible and achievable.
